API
===

The Phantombuster API is composed of HTTPS endpoints returning JSON data.

We deliberately made the API extremely simple to use. Any developer should be able to get responses in a matter of minutes.

Versioning
----------

All API endpoints URLs start with ``https://phantombuster.com/api/vX/`` where ``X`` is the version number of the API. For now, only version ``1`` exists.

When breaking changes will be made to the API, this version number will increase.

Response format
---------------

All endpoints return JSON following the `JSend <http://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend>`_ specification. It basically means all successfull responses have HTTP code ``200`` and look like this:

::

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {
            ...
        }
    }

Authentication and request format
---------------------------------

Authentication is dead simple: put your API key in the ``X-Phantombuster-Key-1`` HTTP header (or in the ``key`` parameter) of every request you make.

To get your API key, simply go to your `settings page <https://phantombuster.com/settings>`_ and click ``Reveal``.

Request parameters should be put in the HTTP ``GET`` query string, like a normal HTTP ``GET`` request. Here is how a typical request looks like:

::

    GET /api/v1/agent/785/launch.json?command=casperjs&saveLaunchOptions=1 HTTP/1.1
    Host: phantombuster.com
    X-Phantombuster-Key-1: YOUR_API_KEY

You can also put your API key as a ``GET`` parameter. This is not recommended because your key might show up in log files:

::

    GET /api/v1/agent/785/launch.json?command=casperjs&saveLaunchOptions=1&key=YOUR_API_KEY HTTP/1.1
    Host: phantombuster.com

Please be aware that your key is precious as anyone who knows it can launch your agents (and do other mean things). Do not hesitate to generate a new one if you think it has been compromised.

Errors
------

If something bad happened, the HTTP code will be ``4XX`` or ``5XX`` and the response will look like this:

::

    {
        "status": "error",
        "message": "Description of what happened"
    }

The error response might also contain a ``code`` field and a ``data`` field describing the error in more details.

Here are some error HTTP codes you might encounter:

- ``400``: missing parameter or something else wrong with the given parameters
- ``401``: missing API key or wrong API key
- ``404``: the requested object was not found (bad ID?)
- ``500``: for some reason our servers could not handle your request

agent/{id}.json
---------------

::

    /api/v1/agent/{id}.json

Get an agent record.

``{id}`` (``Number``)
    ID of the agent to retrieve.

``withScript`` (``String``)
    If present and not empty, and if the agent has an associated script, also return the script record.

Sample response:

::

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {
            "id": 1763,
            "name": "Nice Agent",
            "scriptId": 1902,
            "proxy": "none",
            "proxyAddress": null,
            "proxyUsername": null,
            "proxyPassword": null,
            "disableWebSecurity": false,
            "ignoreSslErrors": false,
            "loadImages": true,
            "launch": "manually",
            "nbLaunches": 94,
            "showDebug": true,
            "awsFolder": "nVFRid8kvsuPeuCL80DnBg",
            "executionTimeLimit": 5,
            "fileMgmt": "folders",
            "fileMgmtMaxFolders": 10,
            "lastEndMessage": "Execution time limit reached",
            "lastEndStatus": "error",
            "userAwsFolder": "QwYH17CB0Xj",
            "script": {
                "id": 1902,
                "name": "nice_agent.coffee",
                "source": "phantombuster",
                "url": null,
                "text": " ... script contents ... ",
                "httpHeaders": null,
            }
        }
    }

agent/{id}/launch
-----------------

::

    /api/v1/agent/{id}/launch

Add an agent to the launch queue.

This endpoint supports three types of outputs:

    - JSON output (by setting ``output`` to ``json``, which is the default) to get back a ``containerId`` in JSON. This ID can later be used to track this launch and get console output by calling ``/api/v1/agent/{agentId}/output.json?containerId={containerId}``.

    ~ or ~

    - `Event stream <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events>`_ output (by setting ``output`` to ``event-stream``) to get a ``text/event-stream`` HTTP response. Each line of console output is sent as an event stream message starting with ``data:``. When you receive the first message, you know the agent has started. When the agent has finished, the connection is closed. At regular intervals, event stream comments (starting with ``:``) are sent to keep the connection alive. `See a demo of this endpoint in action. <http://demo.phantombuster.com/event-stream.html>`_

    ~ or ~

    - Raw output (by setting ``output`` to ``raw``) to get an HTTP ``text/plain``, chunked, streaming response of the raw console output of the agent. This is NOT recommended as almost all HTTP clients will timeout at one point or another, especially if your agent stays in queue for a few minutes (in which case the endpoint will send *zero* bytes for a few minutes, waiting for the agent to start â€” even cURL and Wget struggle to handle non-transmitting HTTP responses).

``{id}`` (``Number``)
    ID of the agent to launch.

``output`` (``String``)
    Either ``json``, ``event-stream`` or ``raw`` (optional, default to ``json``). This allows you to choose what type of response to receive.

``command`` (``String``)
    Command to use when launching the agent (optional). Can be either ``casperjs``, ``phantomjs`` or ``node``.

``argument`` (``String``)
    JSON argument as a string (optional). The argument can be retrieved with ``buster.argument`` in the agent's script.

``saveLaunchOptions`` (``String``)
    If present and not empty, ``command`` and ``argument`` will be saved as the default launch options for the agent.

Sample response of JSON output:

::

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {
            "containerId": 76426
        }
    }

Sample response of event stream output:

::

    : container 76426 in queue

    : container 76426 in queue

    data: This a console output line!
    data: 

    : container 76426 still running

    data: And this is

    data: another one :)
    data: 

    : container 76426 ended

Sample response of raw output:

::

    This is a console output line!
    And this is another one :)

agent/{id}/abort.json
---------------------

::

    /api/v1/agent/{id}/abort.json

Abort all running instances of the agent.

``{id}`` (``Number``)
    ID of the agent to stop.

Sample response:

::

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": null
    }

agent/{id}/output.json
----------------------

::

    /api/v1/agent/{id}/output.json

Get data from an agent: console output, status, progress and messages. This API endpoint is specifically designed so that it's easy to get incremental data from an agent.

This endpoint has two modes:

    - "Track" mode (by setting ``mode`` to ``track``, which is the default when a ``containerId`` is specified) to get console output from a particular instance of the agent. In this mode, requests must have the ``containerId`` parameter set to the instance's ID from which you wish to get console output.

    ~ or ~

    - "Most Recent" mode (by setting ``mode`` to ``most-recent``, which is the default when ``containerId`` is left at ``0``) to get console output from the most recent instance of the agent. In this mode, your first call should have parameter ``containerId`` left at ``0``. From then on, all subsequent calls must have parameter ``containerId`` set to the previously returned container ID (when a new instance of the agent is started, a different ``containerId`` will be returned).

``{id}`` (``Number``)
    ID of the agent from which to retrieve the output, status and messages.

``mode`` (``String``)
    Either ``track`` or ``most-recent`` (optional, defaults to ``most-recent`` if ``containerId`` is left at ``0``, otherwise defaults to ``track``). This controls from which instance of the agent the console output is returned. In "Most Recent" mode, the most recent instance is selected each time a request is made. In "Track" mode, the console output from a particular instance is returned, as specified by the ``containerId`` parameter.

``containerId`` (``Number``)
    ID of the instance from which to get console output (optional, ``0`` by default). In "Most Recent" mode, always use the last ``containerId`` you received on a previous call or ``0`` for the first call. In "Track" mode, always set this parameter to the instance's ID from which you wish to get console ouput.

``fromMessageId`` (``Number``)
    Return the agent's messages starting from this ID (optional, ``-1`` by default). If not present or ``-1``, no messages are returned. Use the biggest message ID you received on a previous call to only get fresh messages.

``fromOutputPos`` (``Number``)
    Return the agent's console output starting from this position (optional, ``0`` by default). This number corresponds to the number of bytes emitted by the agent. Use the last ``outputPos`` you received on a previous call to only get new output data.

Note: The ``agentStatus`` and ``containerStatus`` fields have 3 possible values: ``running``, ``queued`` or ``not running``. The ``containerStatus`` field is only present in "Track" mode and represents the status of the tracked agent instance.
