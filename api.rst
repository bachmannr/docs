API
===

The Phantombuster API is composed of HTTPS endpoints returning JSON data.

We deliberately made the API extremely simple to use. Any developer should be able to get responses in a matter of minutes.

Versioning
----------

All API endpoints URLs start with ``https://phantombuster.com/api/vX/`` where ``X`` is the version number of the API. For now, only version ``1`` exists.

When breaking changes will be made to the API, this version number will increase.

Response format
---------------

All endpoints return JSON following the `JSend <http://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend>`_ specification. It basically means all successfull responses have HTTP code ``200`` and look like this:

::

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {
            ...
        }
    }

Authentication and request format
---------------------------------

Authentication is dead simple: put your API key in the ``X-Phantombuster-Key-1`` HTTP header (or in the ``key`` parameter) of every request you make.

To get your API key, simply go to your `settings page <https://phantombuster.com/settings>`_ and click ``Reveal``.

Request parameters should be put in the HTTP ``GET`` query string, like a normal HTTP ``GET`` request. Here is how a typical request looks like:

::

    GET /api/v1/agent/785/launch.json?command=casperjs&saveLaunchOptions=1 HTTP/1.1
    Host: phantombuster.com
    X-Phantombuster-Key-1: YOUR_API_KEY

You can also put your API key as a ``GET`` parameter. This is not recommended because your key might show up in log files:

::

    GET /api/v1/agent/785/launch.json?command=casperjs&saveLaunchOptions=1&key=YOUR_API_KEY HTTP/1.1
    Host: phantombuster.com

Please be aware that your key is precious as anyone who knows it can launch your agents (and do other mean things). Do not hesitate to generate a new one if you think it has been compromised.

Errors
------

If something bad happened, the HTTP code will be ``4XX`` or ``5XX`` and the response will look like this:

::

    {
        "status": "error",
        "message": "Description of what happened"
    }

The error response might also contain a ``code`` field and a ``data`` field describing the error in more details.

Here are some error HTTP codes you might encounter:

- ``400``: missing parameter or something else wrong with the given parameters
- ``401``: missing API key or wrong API key
- ``404``: the requested object was not found (bad ID?)
- ``500``: for some reason our servers could not handle your request

agent/{id}.json
---------------

::

    /api/v1/agent/{id}.json

Get an agent record.

``{id}`` (``Number``)
    ID of the agent to retrieve.

``withScript`` (``String``)
    If present and not empty, and if the agent has an associated script, also return the script record.

Sample response:

::

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {
            "id": 1763,
            "name": "Nice Agent",
            "scriptId": 1902,
            "proxy": "none",
            "proxyAddress": null,

            "fileMgmtMaxFolders": 10,
            "lastEndMessage": "Execution time limit reached",
            "lastEndStatus": "error",
            "userAwsFolder": "QwYH17CB0Xj",
            "script": {
                "id": 1902,
                "name": "nice_agent.coffee",
                "source": "phantombuster",
                "url": null,
                "text": " ... script contents ... ",
                "httpHeaders": null,
            }
        }
    }

agent/{id}/launch.json
----------------------

::

    /api/v1/agent/{id}/launch.json

Add an agent to the launch queue. This call always succeeds â€” to know if the agent was successfully added to the launch queue, call either ``/api/v1/agent/{id}/output.json`` or ``/api/v1/user.json``.

``{id}`` (``Number``)
    ID of the agent to launch.

``command`` (``String``)
    Command to use when launching the agent (optional). Can be either ``casperjs`` or ``phantomjs``.

``argument`` (``String``)
    JSON argument as a string (optional). The argument can be retrieved with ``buster.argument`` in the agent's script.

``saveLaunchOptions`` (``String``)
    If present and not empty, ``command`` and ``argument`` will be saved as the default launch options for the agent.

Sample response:

::

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": null
    }

agent/{id}/abort.json
---------------------

::

    /api/v1/agent/{id}/abort.json

Abort a running agent.

``{id}`` (``Number``)
    ID of the agent to stop.

Sample response:

::

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": null
    }

agent/{id}/output.json
----------------------

::

    /api/v1/agent/{id}/output.json

Get data from an agent: console output, status and messages. This API endpoint is specifically designed so that it's easy to get incremental data from a running agent. To do so, your first call should have all parameters set to ``0``. From then on, all subsequent calls should have parameters set to the values returned by Phantombuster on the previous call.

``{id}`` (``Number``)
    ID of the agent from which to retrieve the output, status and messages.

``fromMessageId`` (``Number``)
    Return the agent's messages starting from this ID (optional, ``0`` by default). If not present or ``0``, returns a few last messages. Use the biggest message ID you received on a previous call to only get fresh messages.

``fromOutputPos`` (``Number``)
    Return the agent's console output starting from this position (optional, ``0`` by default). This number roughly corresponds to the number of bytes emitted by the agent. Use the last ``outputPos`` you received on a previous call to only get new output data.

``containerId`` (``Number``)
    Get console output from a specific launch (optional, ``0`` by default). If not present or ``0``, Phantombuster will select the most relevant launch (either a running agent or the last finished run). Use the last ``containerId`` you received on a previous call to always get relevant console output lines. When you receive a different ``containerId`` than the one you requested with, you know that at least one new agent launch occurred.

Sample response:

::

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {
            "status": "running",
            "runningContainers": 1,
            "queuedContainers": 0,
            "containerId": 76427,
            "messages": [

                        "Launch type: manual",
                        "Execution time limit: 60s"
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "output": "* Container a255b8220379 started in directory /home/phantom/agent",
            "outputPos": 245
        }
    }

script/{id}.{ext}
-----------------

::

    /api/v1/script/{id}.{ext}

Get a script record.

``{id}`` (``Number``)
    ID of the script to retrieve.

``{ext}`` (``String``)
    Either ``json`` or ``txt``. If ``txt`` is used, the script is returned as raw text data, without any JSON.

Sample response:

::

    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {
            "id": 1902,
            "name": "nice_agent.coffee",
            "source": "phantombuster",
